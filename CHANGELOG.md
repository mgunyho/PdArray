# Changelog for PdArray

## v2.1.1 (2024-05-07)

Fixed used of undefined values in Ministep when module is added while plugin is bypassed (thanks @FalkTX)

## v2.1.0 (2023-01-16)

Fairly large update to Miniramp.

- New outputs: EOC (End of Cycle) and FINISH (inverse of GATE). This makes chaining Arrays easier (thanks @davephillips for the feature suggestion).
- New input: STOP / reset
- Miniramp is now wider, to fit the new input and outputs
- Polyphonic behavior of Miniramp is now consistent with that of Ministep: if either the trigger or CV input are polyphonic, the output is polyphonic as well, and if the trigger, CV or STOP inputs are monophonic, they affect all channels
- New right click menu option to update trigger duration only when a trigger is received
- Duration and CV amount knob tooltips now show the duration / CV amount correctly in seconds
- Extended Miniramp manual to explain polyphony

Additional changes:

- Updated screenshots in manual to Rack V2

## v2.0.6 (2021-12-29)

Ported to Rack v2.

- Implement v2 API features, such as input/output labels, and improved labels for switches. Also, glow-in-the-dark array cursors.
- If the array contains more than 5000 elements, the array data is saved as a wav file in the patch storage directory
- Improvements to the array size and Ministep step count text boxes

As part of the v2 update, PdArray is now licensed under the EUPL.
